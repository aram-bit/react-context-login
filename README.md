Hello guys!!!
In this project firstly I have created dark mode.
Secondly I created a login form.
This project is based on react.
I created components,then I used useState for them and user and finally I used usecontext to avoid passing props to parents that They dont need.
In conclusion I have done these to have a neat set of codes.ðŸ˜Š
